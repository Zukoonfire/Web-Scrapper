# Web-Scrapper
This project demonstrates the use of Go's concurrency features, including goroutines, channels, and worker pools, to build a concurrent web scraper. The scraper fetches data from multiple URLs simultaneously, processes the content using the goquery library, and extracts specific parts of the HTML for readability.
